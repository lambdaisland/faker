We're still payin' the owner for the busted speakers...","I ain't just a legend in the fighting world, ya know. I'm also well-known in biker circles! Prolly considered the top biker in America! But I got my sights set even higher! One day, I'll...","Candy's really into gardening lately. Ya know those little onion-lookin' things? They kinda look like me? Oh yeah! Bulbs! So, she planted a buncha bulbs in the garden, see? An' before long...","Wanna know what I like most about Candy? Too bad! That's top secret privileged information, bub! I don't want you fallin' in love with her, too! Not that you could compete, but still...","Why do women take so long to shop, anyway? Don't tell Candy I said this, but that girl took like 2 hours to decide between a couple of blouses that were the exact same color! No difference!","Wataaah!","Achoo!","My journey to become the ultimate fighter has only just begun.","Each time I fight, I learn something new. This journey has been fruitful.","Even if my fists were to turn to dust, I would not give up in my quest!","The more I learn, the more I realize how far I am from the end of my journey.","The power I am after is the power to win - not the power to destroy!","You must defeat my Shoryuken to stand a chance!","No need to speak. Your fists told me everything I need to know about you.","If you go into the ring expecting to fail, you will. Believe in yourself!","Power alone is no guarantee of victory. Keep your eyes on your opponent!","Give it your all!","These two fists are everything to me!","Do not place so much importance on winning. The fight itself has value.","A strong fighter is not one who always wins, but one who stands after defeat.","All the worlds fighters must bow before the undisputed king!","I'm inspired by the courage of those who have fallen before my mighty fist.","I will not rest until I know the meaning of the fight!","They call me the king for a reason fool! You never stood a chance!","Have you tested him in battle as well? Impressive, I shall remember you.","You are not strong enough to go toe to toe with the undisputed king!","You are not a warrior, you're a beginner.","Stand up!","Now you know the power of the king!","Training is fun if you set your mind to a specific goal to work toward!","Yes! I'm doing great! Gotta keep this up!","Awesome fight! I'm on top of my game today!","Oh no! I almost forgot I'm s'posed to meet Kei today! I'm gonna be late!","I got some kind of invitation in the mail from Karin. I'd better reply!","Yeah! That was great!","That was so fun! We have to do it again soon!","Phew! That was a close one! Wanna go again?","You're pretty strong, but you need to mix up your moves a bit more.","Thanks for fighting me!","That's a wrap!","Evil? Like the concept of gods, this is a meaningless human construct.","No need to contemplate your future. That is for me to determine. Not you.","My name, my consciousness, my power...Everything I have, I earned for myself!","I was just looking for a test subject to assist in augmenting my engine...","Before long, a new age will dawn upon the earth and I shall rule over all!","Fear in the face of such power is only natural. No need to hide it.","I am impressed. Now stand so that I may assimilate your data!","I did not expect you to put up such a fight. You have impressed me.","This has been a complete waste of time. Prepare for data deletion!","My name is Seth. Remember it!","I am ruler of all I survey!","You cannot defeat me if you fight only for yourself.","These fists fight for life. They are protected by benevolent spirits.","Let us go to the ends of the earth!","True warriors know no fear. This is not pride, but merely confidence.","My power is bestowed upon me by the spirits. You have no such power!","Spirits and men are both engaged in a constant journey.","I do not fear death. But do not confuse this for resignation.","Do not lament over your loss, for the spirits will heal and rejuvenate you.","I will not stop until I have found my beloved and hold her in my arms!","Let us depart.","The wind speaks to us.","No one compares to my beauty. Nor my strength.","Not even the gods could create something that compares to my beauty.","Blood is the most beautiful color known to mankind.","Power and wealth are meaningless in the face of blinding beauty.","I look the most beautiful when glimpsed in the moment of your demise.","I am at my most beautiful when I am dealing the victory blow.","The least I could do is defeat you with unmatched beauty and grace.","Fighting ugly opponents depresses me to no end.","The weak have nothing to offer and should be culled from the population.","I am beautiful.","Victory is beautiful.","Choosing to fight me means that you are prepared to face defeat!","My muscles are my shield and this shield can withstand any attack!","Compared to my training in Siberia, street fights are mere child's play!","Fans are what drive a wrestler's spirit! With support from my fans, I can't lose!","If you want to build your leg muscles, you should try the Cossack Dance!","I am the Red Cylcone and I destroy anything in my path!","You'd better not try to stand up right away. I threw you awfully hard...","That last move was impressive, comrade. But it was too little, too late!","You need more muscle mass!","You have to want victory!","Khorosho I win!"]],"^B",["^3",["A.X.E.","Abare Tosanami","Abigail Punch","Abigail Smash","Abigail
